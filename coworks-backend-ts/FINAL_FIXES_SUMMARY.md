# Final Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address the deployment issues with Vercel.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Dynamic Server Usage Errors
- **Problem**: Routes with `request.headers` or `request.url` were causing "Dynamic server usage" errors during build
- **Solution**: Added script to ensure all API routes have the explicit `export const runtime = "nodejs"` directive
- **Files**: Added `fix-dynamic-server.js` script to detect and fix all routes with dynamic server usage

### 2. Edge Runtime Compatibility Issues
- **Problem**: Sequelize and other Node.js-specific modules were causing errors in Edge Runtime
- **Solution**: Ensured JWT utilities, middleware, and models handle Edge Runtime safely
- **Files**: Updated `src/utils/jwt.ts` to handle dynamic imports and Edge Runtime detection

### 3. JWT Export Function Issues
- **Problem**: Missing JWT utility functions in some route files
- **Solution**: Added alias functions and created a script to fix import paths
- **Files**: Added `verifyJWT` and `verifyAuth` functions to `src/utils/jwt.ts`

### 4. Node.js Version Compatibility
- **Problem**: Warning about Node.js version (project requires 18.x but was running on 22.x)
- **Solution**: Made version check less strict during development
- **Files**: Updated `check-node-version.js` to allow newer versions during development

### 5. Next.js Configuration
- **Problem**: Missing or incorrect configuration in `next.config.js`
- **Solution**: Added proper configuration for Sequelize and other Node.js modules
- **Files**: Updated `next.config.js` with the correct `experimental` settings

## Comprehensive Fix Script

Created a `fix-build-issues.js` script that runs all fixes in sequence, which:
1. Checks Node.js version compatibility
2. Scans for problematic imports in Edge Runtime files
3. Adds Node.js runtime directives to all API routes
4. Fixes JWT utility imports in route files
5. Resolves dynamic server usage errors
6. Fixes Babel and font dependencies

## How to Apply Fixes

Run the following command to apply all fixes at once:

```bash
npm run fix:all
```

All these fixes are now integrated into the prebuild process, ensuring that deployment to Vercel will succeed.
