please fix the code,logic and lets add some features make modifications to the migrations also if required
1.The branches and seating types lets first focus fixing errorsso while calling seating types it should be called using the short code and should only display that  particular seating type and the seats is should only display all the values for that particular branch and seating type particularly.and each value should be assigned as for example HD101 means HD stands for hotdesk fix the shortcodes for all the branches like NGB .The branches creation should be able to create it dynamically as in only if created with the perticular information should be accesable while testing only 5 branches were created but in the url if i put any other value its still fetching data.Also rather than branch id replace everywhere with branch code and make necessary modifications for that but also branch id can also be used to access it not mandatory value but can be called if required.
2.bookings should show the bookings for that particular user with filteration of active booking ,upcoming booking ,cancelled booking and finished booking all the booking should be associated with seating type code .and bookings are being called for branches that dont exist or bookings that dont exist and the seating types also to be displayed while calling this only the perticular user bookings are to be displayed.
3.For slot booking after selecting the branch and seating types should show the available slots based on the dates and seats available for that perticular seating type in the branch should be done .hot desk ,dedicated desk daily pass and cubicles all have start date and end date and only meeting rooms are hourly basis along with the total duration needs to be sent .Option to book multiple slots should be present and hot desk is minimum 3 months dedicated desk is 2 months with minimum 10 seats .
4.The total no. of seats for the branches based on the seating types along with alll the seats ,booked seats,available seats and based on the date/time needs to be checked if the status is available or not .
5.check all the values are validated and there are images for profile pictures for users and the branches should be assigned images based on seating types so for each seating type will have different images .so make proper migrations for it,short codes to be assigned properly as mentioned three letters make the modification for everything on that basis.ameneties also should be present .
6.i want to implement cloudinary to store images and the image url to be stored in the given image section for profile picture and for branch also the same manner
