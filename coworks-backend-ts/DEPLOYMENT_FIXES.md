# Deployment Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve deployment issues with Vercel and Edge Runtime.

## Issues Fixed

1. **JWT Export Function Issues**
   - Added missing `verifyJWT` and `verifyAuth` functions to `src/utils/jwt.ts`
   - Created a script `fix-jwt-exports.js` to fix import paths in route files
   - These function aliases ensure consistent imports across the codebase

2. **Edge Runtime Compatibility Issues**
   - Updated `fix-runtime.js` to ensure all API routes explicitly use Node.js runtime 
   - Created safe imports for Sequelize models with dynamic imports
   - Updated JWT utilities to handle Edge Runtime safely

3. **Dynamic Server Usage Errors**
   - Added `fix-dynamic-server.js` script to address errors during static generation
   - Fixed routes that use `request.headers` or `request.url` by adding explicit runtime directives
   - Resolved "Dynamic server usage" errors that appeared during deployment
   - Created `fix-problematic-routes.js` to specifically target routes with known issues
   - Added comprehensive directives to prevent static generation attempts on dynamic routes
   - Updated Next.js configuration to improve handling of dynamic routes

4. **Node.js Version Compatibility**
   - Updated `check-node-version.js` to be less strict during development
   - Installed compatible version of `glob` (version 9.3.5) that works with Node.js 18.x
   - This resolves the warnings about unsupported engine versions

5. **Build Process Improvements**
   - Added `fix-jwt-exports.js` and `fix-dynamic-server.js` to the prebuild and vercel-build scripts
   - Updated README with troubleshooting information
   - Created a comprehensive `fix-build-issues.js` script that runs all fixes in one command

## Build Scripts

The project now includes several helper scripts to ensure smooth deployment:

- **check-node-version.js**: Ensures Node.js version compatibility
- **check-edge-imports.js**: Checks for problematic imports in Edge Runtime files
- **fix-runtime.js**: Adds Node.js runtime directives to all API routes
- **fix-jwt-exports.js**: Fixes JWT utility imports in route files
- **fix-dynamic-server.js**: Resolves dynamic server usage errors in API routes
- **fix-problematic-routes.js**: Specifically fixes routes with known dynamic server usage issues
- **fix-babel.js**: Fixes Babel dependencies
- **fix-fonts.js**: Fixes font import issues
- **fix-build-issues.js**: Comprehensive script that runs all fixes in sequence

## How to Use

For a comprehensive fix that addresses all issues at once, run:

```bash
npm run fix:all
```

Alternatively, run the pre-build script before deployment:

```bash
npm run prebuild
```

This will automatically run all necessary fixes to prepare for deployment.

To target specific problematic routes that cause "Dynamic server usage" errors, run:

```bash
npm run fix:problematic-routes
```

## Directives Added to Problematic Routes

The `fix-problematic-routes.js` script adds these important directives to all problematic routes:

```typescript
export const runtime = "nodejs";  // Force Node.js runtime
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";  // Prevent static generation
export const fetchCache = "force-no-store";  // Disable caching of fetch calls
```

These directives work together to ensure:
1. The route uses Node.js instead of Edge Runtime (required for Sequelize)
2. The route is always generated dynamically at request time
3. Data fetching is always fresh and not cached

## Verification

We've verified that these fixes successfully resolve the deployment issues by:

1. Running local builds that complete without dynamic server usage errors
2. Confirming all problematic routes have the required directives
3. Testing that API routes work correctly with proper headers
4. Ensuring the build process completes without errors

## Known Issues

- Some warnings about unsupported engine versions might still appear during installation
- These warnings can be safely ignored as the fixes ensure compatibility at runtime
- The Next.js config shows a warning about `disableStaticFiles` but the build completes successfully

## Future Improvements

- Consider upgrading to Node.js 20.x when all dependencies are compatible
- Enhance the fix scripts to handle more edge cases automatically
- Add more validation to ensure routes are properly configured
- Update to Next.js 14.3+ when available to benefit from improved handling of dynamic routes
