   - Added `profile_picture` field to Users and Customers
   - Added support for branch images based on seating types
   - Added support for branch amenities

2. **API Endpoint Updates**:
   - Updated branch endpoints to support lookup by branch code
   - Updated seat endpoints to support lookup by seat code
   - Added new endpoints to get seats by branch code
   - Enhanced response formats to include seat counts and organize by seating type
   - Updated bookings endpoint to filter by booking status and validate branch/seating type existence
   - Added new slots API to support different seating types with date ranges
   - Added branch stats API to show detailed seat counts and availability by branch and seating type

3. **Database Migrations**:
   - Added migration scripts for adding all necessary columns
   - Implemented validation for short codes (3-letter format)
   - Added profile pictures for users
   - Added images for branches based on their seating types
   - Added amenities for branches

4. **Data Validation**:
   - Added middleware to validate request parameters and payload
   - Implemented validation for short codes, seat codes, dates, and times
   - Enhanced JWT validation for authentication

## Migration Steps

To apply these changes to your environment, follow these steps:

1. **Run Database Migrations**:
   ```
   npm run migrate:short-codes
   npm run migrate:branch-images
   npm run migrate:branch-amenities
   npm run migrate:seat-code
   npm run migrate:user-profiles
   ```

2. **Test Endpoints**:
   - Test the `/api/branches` endpoint to confirm branches now include short codes
   - Test the `/api/branches/[code]` endpoint to confirm branches can be looked up by code
   - Test the `/api/branches/[code]/seats` endpoint to confirm seats are organized by seating type
   - Test the `/api/slots/available` endpoint to confirm available slots are returned for different seating types
   - Test the `/api/branches/stats` endpoint to verify accurate seat counts and availability

## Branch Stats API Usage Guide

The branch stats API provides comprehensive information about seat availability across branches:

- **Basic usage**: `/api/branches/stats` - Returns stats for all branches and their seats
- **Filter by branch**: `/api/branches/stats?branch_code=DOW` - Stats for a specific branch
- **Filter by date**: `/api/branches/stats?date=2023-06-15` - Check availability on specific date
- **Filter by time slot**: `/api/branches/stats?date=2023-06-15&start_time=09:00&end_time=12:00` - For hourly bookings

The API returns important information:
- **Total seats** - The total number of seats in each branch and by seating type
- **Booked seats** - Both permanently booked seats and seats with bookings for the specified time
- **Available seats** - Seats that can be booked for the specified time period
- **Individual seat status** - Each seat with its status and booking information

This API is useful for:
1. Displaying branch seat availability statistics on dashboards
2. Visualizing seat availability by seating type
3. Checking real-time availability for specific dates and times
4. Generating branch occupancy reports

## Branch Images and Amenities

The API now includes support for branch images and amenities:

### Branch Images
- Images are associated with branches based on the seating types they offer
- Each branch has at least one primary image
- Different images may be used for different seating types
- Image URLs follow a standard format like `/images/branches/[type]-[number].jpg`

### Branch Amenities 
- Each branch has a collection of amenities showing available facilities
- Standard amenities include WiFi, Coffee, Printing, etc.
- Amenities include icons for UI display
- Detailed descriptions are provided for each amenity

## Filtering Bookings by Status

You can filter bookings by status using the `status` query parameter:

- **active**: Currently ongoing bookings
- **upcoming**: Future confirmed bookings
- **cancelled**: All cancelled bookings
- **completed**: Past bookings (either explicitly marked as completed or past their end time)

Example: `/api/bookings?status=active&branch=DOW&type=HTD`

## Booking Different Seating Types

For booking different seating types, use the following requirements:

1. **Hot Desk** (short_code: HTD)
   - Minimum duration: 1 month
   - Minimum seats: 1
   - Example: `/api/slots/available?branch_code=DOW&seating_type_code=HTD&start_date=2023-06-15`

2. **Dedicated Desk** (short_code: DED)
   - Minimum duration: 1 month
   - Minimum seats: 1
   - Example: `/api/slots/available?branch_code=DOW&seating_type_code=DED&start_date=2023-06-15`

3. **Cubicle** (short_code: CUB)
   - Minimum duration: 1 month
   - Example: `/api/slots/available?branch_code=DOW&seating_type_code=CUB&start_date=2023-06-15`

4. **Meeting Room** (short_code: MTG)
   - Hourly booking
   - Minimum duration: 1 hour
   - Example: `/api/slots/available?branch_code=DOW&seating_type_code=MTG&start_date=2023-06-15&start_time=09:00&end_time=11:00`

5. **Daily Pass** (short_code: DPS)
   - Minimum duration: 1 day
   - Example: `/api/slots/available?branch_code=DOW&seating_type_code=DPS&start_date=2023-06-15`

## Validation Improvements

The API now includes comprehensive validation:

- **Short Codes**: All short codes are validated to ensure they follow the 3-letter format
- **Seat Codes**: Seat codes follow the pattern of seating type code followed by 3-digit sequence number
- **Dates and Times**: All date and time parameters are validated for format and validity
- **Authentication**: Enhanced JWT validation to ensure proper authentication
- **Request Bodies**: All JSON payloads are validated for structure and required fields

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Verify all migrations ran successfully
2. Check that your environment has the necessary database schema
3. Ensure branch and seating type records have valid short codes
4. For any records missing codes, you can run the migration scripts again

For additional assistance, refer to the codebase documentation or contact the development team.

## Support Ticket System

We've implemented a robust support ticket system to allow customers to report issues and communicate with branch admins for resolution.

### Ticket Creation and Management

Users can create support tickets with the following details:
- Title and description of the issue
- Category (Internet Issue, Power Outage, Seat Issue, Booking Problem, Meeting Room Issue, Cleanliness, Payment Issue, Other)
- Branch and seating type information
- Optional related booking details

Tickets follow a status workflow:
- `new`: Newly created ticket
- `assigned`: Assigned to a branch admin but not yet responded to
- `in_progress`: Admin has responded and is working on the issue
- `closed`: Issue has been resolved
- `reopened`: Customer has reopened a previously closed ticket

### Admin Branch Management

We've implemented a many-to-many relationship between admins and branches, allowing admins to manage multiple branches and branches to have multiple admins:

- Super admins have access to all branches
- Branch admins can manage one or more specific branches
- Each admin-branch relationship can be marked as primary for default assignment
